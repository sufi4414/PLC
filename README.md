TODO
- Find a way to convert a correct CSV to notes for the writer
- Use the CSV to get the maximum buffer size needed ie by taking the maximum ending time
- Let user edit the BPM
- Convert the whole range of notes into their frequencies (https://muted.io/note-frequencies/)




EXTRA FEATURES
- Let the user define chords (groups of notes) to play at one time
- Be able to play different kinds of sound wave shapes (eg. saw wave, triangle wave, square wave)
- Maybe load other wav files eg. drums into the program and write them as notes
- Add looping
